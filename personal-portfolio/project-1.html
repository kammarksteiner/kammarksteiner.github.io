  <h1>i'll say it again</h1>
    <p><i>i'll say it again</i> is a generative poem created through a 'blackout poetry' style technique. The poem was created by taking a text message and selectively removing certain sections to give the text an entirely different meaning.</p>
    <p>The poem also contained images found through Googles Images by searching the original text message, though I feel the point of the poem comes across better without them.
