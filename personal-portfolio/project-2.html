  <h1>Green Screen</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this project was to place yourself into an environment, with the aim to appear if you were actually there. I chose to place myself on a ferris wheel as it rotated around its axis.</p>
  <p>As I do not have any fancy lighting or green screen equipment, it's quite obvious the video is photoshop, though it displays proof of concept.
